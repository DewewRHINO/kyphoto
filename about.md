<h2 id="content">About me</h2>
<p>Kyle Rodriguez is KylPhoto. He began by taking photos of himself and his family as a kid, offering a unique perspective on all of life’s moments. For a brief period throughout his school years, he pushed aside the art form and focused on his education. Everything changed in 2021. Kyle inherited a camera from his uncle and in a way, rediscovered his passion. Since then, he’s grown to love all genres of photography and has made it his goal to share this feeling with everyone he works with.</p>
